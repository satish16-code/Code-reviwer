❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() { return a + b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
* ❌ `a` and `b` are not defined within the scope of the function. This will likely lead to errors, or unexpected
behavior if they are available in a higher scope.
* ❌ The function doesn't accept any arguments. This limits its reusability, as it can only sum specific, pre-defined
variables `a` and `b`.
* ❌ Lack of error handling or input validation. The function will blindly attempt to add whatever `a` and `b` hold,
which might not be numbers.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
return "Error: Both arguments must be numbers."; // Or throw an error
}
return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔️ The function now accepts `a` and `b` as parameters.
* ✔️ Added input validation to check if `a` and `b` are numbers. Returns an error message if not, preventing unexpected
behavior. Consider throwing an error instead of returning a string, depending on the context.
* ✔️ The function now clearly defines its input (two numbers) and its output (their sum, or an error message).

Final Note: This revised version is more robust and reusable. By accepting arguments and validating input, it avoids
common pitfalls of the original code. Always strive to make functions as self-contained and predictable as possible.
